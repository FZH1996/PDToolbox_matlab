Parameters of the dynamical evolution


% number of populations
P = 1;

% number of pure strategies per population
n = 3;

% initial condition
x0 = [0.2 .7 0.1 ]'; 
If the initial condition is not defined, then a random initial condition is set by default.


% simulation parameters
time = 30;

'f', @fitness1, 


ODE solver can be defined. By default is 'ode45', but can be adjusted.
'ode', 'ode113',


.dynamics = {'rd', 'maynard_rd',  'bnn', 'smith',  'logit'};
'rd' by default.

number of strategies per population
S 

S can be defined manually as a vector with the pure strategies of all populations. But by defining $n>1$, then by default all populations are configured with n pure strategies.

m is a vector with the mass of each population
if m is not defined properly, then a unitary mass is assumed for each population.



It is possible to define multiple dynamics. The resulting dynamic is the combination of dynamics using the variable \gamma.

\sum \gamma(f) V_f

If \gamma is not defined, then the weight of each dynamic is the same, and satisfies $\sum \gamma(i) = 1$






For the finite case we define the rate of the Poisson clock as  R
