\subsection{Pairwise Proportional Imitation}

The $i\th$ agent observes an opponent $j$ at random. Then might change its strategy if  its opponent has a greater fitness. The rate change is 

\begin{equation}
\rho_{ij}(\pi, x) = \frac{x_j}{m} [\pi_j - \pi_i]_+
\end{equation}

In this case, $x_j$ need not be observed. This protocol lead to replicator dynamics.


	

\subsection{Comparison of the Average Payoff}

The $i\th$ agent selects a strategy at random and might switch to it if that strategy has payoff above the average. The agent switch strategy with probability proportional to the excess payoff

\begin{equation}
\rho_{ij}(\pi, x) = \left[ \pi_j - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{k\in S} x_k \pi_k \right]_+
\end{equation}

This protocol lead to BNN dynamics.

\subsection{Pairwise Comparison}

$i\th$ agent selects a strategy at random. If the opponent has a higher fitness, the the agent switch strategy with probability proportional to

\begin{equation}
\rho_{ij}(\pi, x) = \left[ \pi_j - \pi_i \right]_+
\end{equation}

This protocol leads to Smith dynamics.



\subsection{Logit Choice}

The $i\th$ agent selects a strategy at random and change its strategy with a probability proportional to 

\begin{equation}
\rho_{ij}(\pi) = \frac{ \exp(\pi_j \eta^{-1} ) }{ \sum_{k \in S} \exp(\pi_k \eta^{-1} ) }
\end{equation}

This protocol leads to Logit dynamics.
