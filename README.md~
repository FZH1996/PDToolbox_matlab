PDToolbox_matlab
================

PDToolbox is a matlab implementation of some evolutionary dynamics from game theory, such as: replicator dynamics, smith dynamics, logit dynamics, and Brown-von Neumann-Nash.

PDToolbox is designed to facilitate the implementation of any game, regardless of the number of populations, strategies per population, and fitness function.

PDToolbox has some pre-build methods to implement different dynamics and to plot the evolution of the state of each population.


Installation:

- Linux

Download files from the git repository with the following command:

git clone https://github.com/carlobar/PDToolbox_matlab

Open matlab and add the path of the files:

path(path, '/home/carlos/git/PDToolbox_matlab')
path(path, '/home/carlos/git/PDToolbox_matlab/dynamics')
path(path, '/home/carlos/git/PDToolbox_matlab/graphs')
path(path, '/home/carlos/git/PDToolbox_matlab/test')

The path can be verified with the command 'path'.
